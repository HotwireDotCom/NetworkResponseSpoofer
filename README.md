APIResponseSpoofer is a network request-response recording and replaying library for iOS. It's built on top of the [Foundation URL Loading System](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/URLLoadingSystem/URLLoadingSystem.html) to make recording and replaying network requests really simple.
